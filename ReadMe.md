## 📌 Project Overview & Phases

This project is a **digital card** created as a surprise present — built to showcase my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **mobile-first animation**.  
Each file in the project represents a **stage of the surprise**, unfolding like a personal experience.  
It includes **animations**, a **photo gallery**, and a **poem with audio** — all crafted for mobile viewing.

> 💡 **Note:** This project is optimized for **phones only** — animations and layout may not render properly on desktops.

## 🧩 Project Phases

Each file is a separate phase of the experience:

### 1. 🟢 Entry Page – `index.html` + `aniver.css`
- This is the **first screen** the user sees.
- Contains **introductory animations** and transitions.
- Sets the emotional and visual tone for the surprise.
- Styled using `aniver.css`.

### 2. 🖼️ Gallery Phase – `gallery.htm` + `gallery.css`
- Displays a **photo slideshow or gallery**.
- Originally included personal images — now removed for privacy.
- Users can **add their own images** and link them here.
- Uses `gallery.css` for responsive and swipe-friendly layout.

### 3. 📝 Poem & Audio Phase – `new.html` + `note.css`
- A custom **poem page**, serving as the emotional highlight.
- Includes **audio playback** for a more immersive experience.
- Uses `note.css` for elegant typography and visual transitions.

## 📱 Mobile-First Design

- All layouts and animations are designed **exclusively for mobile devices**.
- Utilizes `@media` queries and viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) for responsive performance.
